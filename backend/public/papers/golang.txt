Golang, also known as Go, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. 
It is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and reliability, making it ideal for building 
scalable and high-performance applications. Go features a clean syntax, strong concurrency 
support through goroutines, and a robust standard library. Its static typing and efficient 
garbage collection contribute to fast execution and easy maintenance. Golang is widely used 
in cloud computing, web development, and distributed systems due to its speed and ease of deployment.
