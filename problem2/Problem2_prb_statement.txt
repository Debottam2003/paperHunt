Problem # 2: Consider an application (like
easychair) for managing the paper submission, paper reviewing etc for an
academic conference. Through this application (Web portal), a researcher can
submit his (her) paper for review. Organizer may allot the reviewers for
reviewing papers. Reviews by reviewers are recorded for use in the paper
selection process. The system also caters to reviewers who record answers to evaluation
questions for each paper they review and make recommendations regarding whether
to accept or reject the paper. Moreover, the administrator (organizers) can
prepare a detailed report on the decision of each submitted papers.


The data
requirements are summarized as follows:


■
Authors of papers
are uniquely identified by e-mail id. First and last names are also recorded.


■ Each paper is
assigned a unique identifier by the system and is described by a title,
abstract, and the name of the electronic file containing the paper.


■ A paper may have
multiple authors, but one of the authors is designated as the contact author.


■ Reviewers of
papers are uniquely identified by e-mail address. Each reviewer’s first name,
last name, phone number, affiliation, and topics of interest are also recorded.
Each paper is assigned between two and four reviewers. A reviewer rates each
paper assigned to him or her on a scale of 1 to 5 in four categories: technical
merit, readability, originality, and relevance to the conference.


Finally, each
reviewer provides an overall recommendation regarding each paper.


■ Each review
contains two types of written comments: one to be seen by the review committee
only and the other as feedback to the author(s).
